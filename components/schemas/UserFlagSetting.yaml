      The most important attribute in the response. The _value is the current
      setting for the user. For a boolean feature toggle, this will be true,
      false, or null if there is no defined fallthrough value.
    example: true
  setting:
    type: boolean

      The setting attribute indicates whether you've explicitly targeted this
      user to receive a particular variation. For example, if you have
      explicitly turned off a feature toggle for a user, setting will be false.
      A setting of null means that you haven't assigned that user to a specific
      variation.
    example: null
